// Write a program that reads and stores a series of integers and then computes the sum of the first
// N integers. First ask for N, then read the values into a vector, then calculate the sum of the first
// N values. For example:
// “Please enter the number of values you want to sum:”
// 3
// “Please enter some integers (press '|' to stop):”
// 12 23 13 24 15 |
// “The sum of the first 3 numbers ( 12 23 13 ) is 48.”
// Handle all inputs. For example, make sure to give an error message if the user asks for a sum of
// more numbers than there are in the vector.
